Professional wrestling, while not everyone's cup of tea, is big business. 
What started as a carnival act has turned into a global entertainment industry. 
Netflix recently started showing Monday Night Raw, a program from the biggest North 
American wrestling company, WWE -- this deal is reportedly worth ~$5 billion. 
Like any large entity, WWE is not without competition, drama, and scandal. 

## General Tips

This is very much a step-by-step process. 
Don't go crazy trying to get everything done with as few lines as possible. 
Read the documentation for the AlphaVantage api! Carefully explore the pages from 
cagematch. There isn't a need to get too fancy with anything here -- just go with 
simple function and all should be good. Don't print comments, but use normal text 
for explanations.

## Step 1

In the `calls` folder, you'll find 4 text files -- these are transcripts from 
quarterly earnings calls. Read those files in (glob.glob will be very helpful here), 
with appropriate column names for ticker, quarter, and year columns; this should be 
done within a single function. Perform any data cleaning that you find necessary. 

```{python}
import glob as glob
import pandas as pd

def rd_earnings (file_name):
  glob.glob("C:/Users/jfrench6/Downloads/calls/*.txt")


```

## Step 2

Use the AlphaVantage api to get daily stock prices for WWE and related tickers 
for the last 5 years -- pay attention to your data. You cannot use any AlphaVantage 
packages (i.e., you can only use requests to grab the data). Tell me about the general 
trend that you are seeing. I don't care which viz package you use, but plotly is solid 
and plotnine is good for ggplot2 users.

```{python}
import requests 

```

## Step 3

Just like every other nerdy hobby, professional wrestling draws dedicated fans.
 Wrestling fans often go to cagematch.net to leave reviews for matches, shows, 
 and wrestlers. The following link contains the top 100 matches on cagematch:
  https://www.cagematch.net/?id=111&view=statistics

* What is the correlation between WON ratings and cagematch ratings?

** Which wrestler has the most matches in the top 100?

*** Which promotion has the most matches in the top 100? 

**** What is each promotion's average WON rating?

***** Select any single match and get the comments and ratings for that match into 
a data frame.

```{python}
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import pandas as pd


cm_request = requests.get('https://www.cagematch.net/?id=111&view=statistics')

cm_soup = BeautifulSoup(cm_request.content, features = "html.parser")

# # = id , . = class, select = most important method for all of beautiful soup

cm_top100 = cm_soup.find_all('tr')

cm_top100_df = []

for row in cm_top100:
        # Extract columns within the row (e.g., <td> elements)
        cols = row.find_all('td')  # Assuming data is in <td> tags
        if len(cols) > 0:  # Check if the row contains data
            data_row = [col.get_text(strip=True) for col in cols]
            cm_top100_df.append(data_row)

cm_tb_range = range(0, len(cm_top100))

cm_df = pd.DataFrame(cm_top100_df)

print(cm_df)
```

```{python}
import numpy as np

# Convert relevant columns to numeric
cm_df[2] = pd.to_numeric(cm_df[2], errors='coerce')  # Assuming WON ratings are in column 2
cm_df[3] = pd.to_numeric(cm_df[3], errors='coerce')  # Assuming cagematch ratings are in column 3

# Calculate correlation between WON ratings and cagematch ratings
correlation = cm_df[2].corr(cm_df[3])
print(f"Correlation between WON ratings and cagematch ratings: {correlation}")

# Find the wrestler with the most matches in the top 100
wrestler_counts = cm_df[4].value_counts()  # Assuming wrestler names are in column 4
top_wrestler = wrestler_counts.idxmax()
print(f"Wrestler with the most matches in the top 100: {top_wrestler}")

# Find the promotion with the most matches in the top 100
promotion_counts = cm_df[5].value_counts()  # Assuming promotion names are in column 5
top_promotion = promotion_counts.idxmax()
print(f"Promotion with the most matches in the top 100: {top_promotion}")

# Calculate each promotion's average WON rating
promotion_avg_won = cm_df.groupby(5)[2].mean()  # Group by promotion and calculate mean of WON ratings
print("Average WON rating for each promotion:")
print(promotion_avg_won)

# Select a single match and get comments and ratings for that match
match_id = '12345'  # Replace with actual match ID
match_url = f'https://www.cagematch.net/?id=111&nr={match_id}'
match_request = requests.get(match_url)
match_soup = BeautifulSoup(match_request.content, features="html.parser")

comments = match_soup.find_all('div', class_='comments')
ratings = match_soup.find_all('div', class_='rating')

comments_list = [comment.get_text(strip=True) for comment in comments]
ratings_list = [rating.get_text(strip=True) for rating in ratings]

match_df = pd.DataFrame({
  'Comment': comments_list,
  'Rating': ratings_list
})
print(match_df)
```

## Step 4

You can't have matches without wrestlers. The following link contains the top 100 
wrestlers, according to cagematch: https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&view=statistics

*** Of the top 100, who has wrestled the most matches?

***** Of the top 100, which wrestler has the best win/loss?

```{python}

```

## Step 5

With all of this work out of the way, we can start getting down to strategy.

First, what talent should WWE pursue? Advise carefully.

Second, reconcile what you found in steps 3 and 4 with Netflix's relationship with WWE.
 Use the data from the following page to help make your case: 
 https://wrestlenomics.com/tv-ratings/

Third, do you have any further recommendations for WWE?
